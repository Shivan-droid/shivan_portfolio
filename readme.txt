In order to build my portfolio I used a combination of my old and new images, to showcase my work in photography. The challanges that I faced were to optimize the images and make them be the same aspect ratio. Another challenge was making grids and having them spread evenly without touching each other.  
I overcame these challenges by doing a lot of research online with the help of google, w3schools, IMDAC and stackoverflow.
I learned how to properly use grids and bootstrap. Also learned how to target a div or element directly through html and through css.
Resources that I used were- Bootstrap docs (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/), W3schools (https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_theme_me.asp), and goggle fonts. 
The images I used were all taken by me.
