How? Challenges? overcame?
waht you learned? 
add all resources you used, fonts, images


to build my web portfolio I used a combination of my old and new images, put them together to showcase my work in photography. The challanges that I faced were optimizing the images and making the images to be the same aspect ratio. 
I learned how to properly use grids and how to use bootstrap. 
Resources that I used were- Bootstrap docs (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/), W3schools (https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_theme_me.asp) the base theme that I used for my website, and goggle fonts. 
The images I used were all taken by me.
